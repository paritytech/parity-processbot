# Commands

To be posted as a comment in the Pull Request. **Your whole comment should only have the command**.

- `bot merge` to automatically merge it once checks pass (if approvals have been
  given).
- `bot merge force` to attempt merge without waiting for checks (if approvals
  have been given).
- `bot merge cancel` to cancel a pending `bot merge`.
- `bot compare substrate` to see a diff between current branch's Substrate.
  version and the latest Polkadot release's Substrate version.
- `bot rebase` to merge origin/master.
- `bot burnin` to build and deploy the PR for a burn-in test.

Commands should all be defined in [constants.rs](./src/constants.rs).

# Deployment

Note: As of March 26 of 2021, the bot has been running on production with [tag 0.5.0](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-processbot/releases/tag/v0.5.0) since October 27 of 2020. Although many bugs have been reported since then, that is the current "stable" version which developers are used to. `master` has since then received commits which have not landed in production; therefore, if a "doom scenario" comes up, it's advised that you always deploy that tag instead of retagging master for the time being.

The bot is automatically deployed by pushing a tag with one of the following formats

- `/^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+.*$/`, e.g. `v1.1`, will deploy it to production (cluster `parity-prod`).

- `/^pre-v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+.*$/`, e.g. `pre-v0.6` will deploy to staging (cluster `parity-stg`).
  - The staging package is deployed to a dedicated separate Github App. There's a [a (private) repository for staging](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-for-processbot-staging)
which has it installed, already set up with a mirrored [a (private) project on Gitlab](https://gitlab.parity.io/parity/polkadot-for-processbot-staging) for CI.

The deployment's status can be followed through [Gitlab Pipelines on the parity-processbot mirror](https://gitlab.parity.io/parity/parity-processbot/-/pipelines) ([example](https://gitlab.parity.io/parity/parity-processbot/-/jobs/867102)).

## Notes

- All of the relevant configuration for deployment lives in the [./kubernetes/processbot](./kubernetes/processbot) folder. The environment variables for both staging and production are in `values*.yml`; if you add one, it also needs to be added to `templates/processbot.yaml`.
 - If any secrets need to be changed, contact the devops team.

# Configuration

## Project Owners <a name="project-owners"></a>

Project owners can be configured by placing a `Process.json` file in the root of your repository. **The bot always considers only the `master` branch's version of the file**. See [./Process.json](./Process.json) or [Substrate's Process.json](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/Process.json) for examples.

The file should have a valid JSON array of `{ "project_name": string, "owner": string, "matrix_room_id": string }` where:

- `project_name` is the [Github Project](#github-project)'s name
- `owner` is the Github Username of the project's lead
- `matrix_room_id` is the project's room address on Matrix, like `"!yBKstWVBkwzUkPslsp:matrix.parity.io"`. It's not currently used, but needs to be defined.

## Runtime

Some of the bot's configuration (e.g. the number of required reviewers for a pull request) can be managed through environment variables defined in [./src/config.rs](./src/config.rs)

# Criteria for merge

## Approvals

A Pull Request needs either

- `$MIN_REVIEWERS` (default: 2) [core-dev](#core-devs) member approvals, or
- One [substrateteamleads](#substrateteamleads) member approval, or
- One approval from the project owner **for the PR**. Projects are managed
  [through the Github UI](#github-project) and its [owners](#project-owners)
  are defined in `Process.json`. If the PR does not belong to any project or if
  it has been approved by a project owner which is not the PR's project owner,
  then this rule will not take effect.

---

For the sake of the following explanation, consider "Allowed Developers"
to be either
- [Project Owners](#project-owners)
- [substrateteamleads](#substrateteamleads)

When the bot is commanded to merge, if the PR is short of 1 approval and the
command's requester might not be able to fulfill the approval count on their
own, then the bot will try to pitch in the missing approval if the requester is
an Allowed Developer. The reasoning for this feature is as follows:

1. PR authors cannot approve their own merge requests, although Allowed
   Developers should have the means to bypass that requirement.

2. If the Allowed Developer has already approved and it's still short of one,
   they cannot "approve twice" in order to meet the quota. In that case, the
   bot should contribute one approval in order to help them meet that
   requirement.

## Checks and statuses

All CI statuses and checks should be green when using `bot merge` (can be
bypassed by using `bot merge force`).

- What is a project column and how do I attach one? <a name="github-project"></a>
	- A project column is necessary for Processbot to identify a [Project Owner](#project-owners).
	- A pull request can be attached to a project column using the Github web UI (similar to attaching a label):

		- No project *(cannot be recognised)*

		![](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-processbot/blob/master/no-project.png)

		- A project but no column *(cannot be recognised)*
